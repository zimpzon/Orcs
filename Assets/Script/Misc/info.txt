BUGS
  enemies on the way in can be killed and remain deadly (and white)
  player can leave arena on left and right sides

SMART DESIGN
 really need current and new value for choices
 save baby knight? can then use orc enemies
 friendly is blue'ish, deadly is red'ish.
 COHERENT DESIGN, it is now spells :)
  declarative spawning!
  batter enemy creation than prefab. scriptable objects? factory? json? custom?
  balance/rewards for picking up orc and killing enemies
  synergies for choices, aha-moments for players, feels good (chance to X on shot + attack speed)

BRAINSTORM
  FROZEN enemies cannot harm you?
  chain lightning...
  health + health regen pickups that are temp (voluntary uregency)   urgency with "loot goblins"? / money
  rare pickup that gives a bonus choice
  drop stuff that attacks when and enemy is close
  pool of stuff on the floor
  conditions on upgrades, so you can upgrade weapon fully without shop, but after using shop you will get other choices.
  when you get an upgrade, immediately fire it, much more fun
  taking damage = 0.5 sec shield, very long cooldown
  random portal leading to bonus map?
  ICONS on choices would help A LOT! Machinegun, orc, explosion for dam or dead ogre? green ogre for poison
  spawn large stationary enemies? either shooting or just being in the way.
  very dark map?
  healers, pretty awesome :p
  horn of Orcdor: every 10 seconds the baby orc will walk towards you OR if not picked up for X seconds
  ai can be reused for multiple chars with no or simples param changes. still gives the impression of many enemies.
     - ai can have some options (exists: speed, hp, weight), projectiles, cd, etc. snipers, shotguns

SPAWNS
  more spawns when killed faster
  timer based sections, to control pace
  special events besides grunts (bosses, casters, etc.)
  orcs, every x orcs spawns a boss, bosses reward:
  background color change for incoming danger! bosses, waves etc.
   moving wall of big ogres, need to shoot hole (move backwards lolz?)
   shapes, desired moving target (ex formations)
   PRIORITY destinations. 100% = ignore player, 50% = half notice range
  LIKE DIABLO: add icons to enemies for easy reuse. High hp, fast, etc.
