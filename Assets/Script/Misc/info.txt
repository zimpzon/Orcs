BALANCING!
DAMAGE NUMBERS:
  machine gun: 50
  shotgun pellet: 10
  sniper: 100
  sawblade, large: total damage: 400


SMART DESIGN
  declarative spawning!
  batter enemy creation than prefab. scriptable objects? factory? json? custom?
  conditions on upgrades, so you can upgrade weapon fully without shop, but after using shop you will get other choices.
  when you get an upgrade, immediately fire it, much more fun
  balance/rewards for picking up orc and killing enemies
  synergies for choices, aha-moments for players, feels good (chance to X on shot + attack speed)

GRAPHIX:
  awesome chars:

BRAINSTORM
  attachment: shotgun (unlock at some boss?)
  attachment: sniper (or laser from Chuck?), possibly pushing to form a path? (unlock at some boss?)
  more crit %, more crit damage
  % chance to drop xp in kill, crits increase change (synergy)
  buy: all enemies have 1% chance to drop 1-3 gold, $50
  gold left when you die will remain (just more more round :)
  choice: next orc will throw 10x money
  different background color? brown was nice...
  very dark map?
  TRIED, was a mess: physics collisions? performace is not an issue! allows walls! and gauntlet style doors.
  healers, pretty awesome :p
  pickup saw: lvl1 release a saw on orc pickup, lvl2 +1 saw, lvl3 +1 saw
  horn of Orcdor: every 10 seconds the baby orc will walk towards you OR if not picked up for X seconds
  urgency with "loot goblins"? / money
  (synergies, every X bullet fired do Y, Jedi orc that follows you)
   pool of stuff on the floor
  ai can be reused for multiple chars with no or simples param changes. still gives the impression of many enemies.
   ai can have some options (exists: speed, hp, weight), projectiles, cd, etc. snipers, shotguns
  could have a level with walls and special enemies that are not kinematic
  ?: choices can have multiple children

SPAWNS
  more spawns when killed faster
  timer based sections, to control pace
  special events besides grunts (bosses, casters, etc.)
  orcs, every x orcs spawns a boss, bosses reward:
  background color change for incoming danger! bosses, waves etc.
   moving wall of big ogres, need to shoot hole (move backwards lolz?)
   shapes, desired moving target (ex formations)
   PRIORITY destinations. 100% = ignore player, 50% = half notice range
  LIKE DIABLO: add icons to enemies for easy reuse. High hp, fast, etc.
