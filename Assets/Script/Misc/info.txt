CAM: 8.4

small levels, rooms

NEXT
  // Light spell'ish color : 253, 248, 220 -> 250, 239, 129

current weapons
  burst of frost MORE SWAG!!!
  poison, axe? MORE SWAG!!!! A bunch of small poison circles? Particle circle does not follow dagger speed.

  swirling swords OR shields that clears a path? small one pushes in, large ones out? (SUCK in enemies? need cool thing, move around in some cool way?)
   SWAG could be a few small circles, then blast aginst player, and right past out of the screen.

  (sawblades) saw of sacrilege (of sadness (for your enemy))

BUGS
  POISON completely skips some cycles, others has 1 dagger or so. Cache empty??
  dying WITHOUT seing how!
  knife count seems wrong when adding % (use non-%?)
  level up pause while an enemy is flying dead keeps spraying blood.
  reset of weapons fokked up?

SMART DESIGN
  DECREASE rewards for repeated choices instead of increase! Encourages diversification!
 the most fun so far is moving between spread out enemies and escaping. Much fun!
   can this be expanded upon? ablities that carves paths?
 PITCH OF pickup xp increases
 Bosses could cycle through gold, weapon, rambo, starting at a random place.
 VAMPIRE SURVIVORS use simple choices and details on mouseover. And buy button at mouseover menu.
 really need current and new value for choices
 friendly is blue'ish, deadly is red'ish.
 synergies for choices, aha-moments for players, feels good (chance to X on shot + attack speed)

BRAINSTORM
  AUTO GEN levels. Seed + mobtypes, etc. Then Set up the timeline until EXIT opens!
 sword explodes at furthest point
 +experience upgrade
LOSE ALL GOLD BUT PERMANENTLY +dam and +gold (buy shop item) (MIGHT ALSO work just with a high price, easier to implement but u dont get the "feeling")
  background in title screen could have moving enemies.
  can "ascending" like Cookie Clicker be done? Possibly with new chars? reset all progress and get double gold and xp? could be greyed out button with explanation.
  enemies that follows paths and just shoots?
  shield/sword enemies loses items which flies away, and continues as plain enemies.
  use forcedDestination to make groups? if not in a group scan for friends, attach them to you and assign an offset they will maintain.
  chance to deflect projectiles? make 'em blue.
  hit furthest enemy :)
  chain-something, lightning...
  drop stuff that attacks when an enemy is close
  pool of stuff on the floor
  ICONS on choices would help A LOT! Machinegun, orc, explosion for dam or dead ogre? green ogre for poison
  spawn large stationary enemies? either shooting or just being in the way. Could use avoidance for actors.
  horn of Orcdor: every 10 seconds the baby orc will walk towards you OR if not picked up for X seconds

SPAWNS
  background color change for incoming danger! bosses, waves etc.
   moving wall of big ogres, need to shoot hole (move backwards lolz?)
   shapes, desired moving target (ex formations)
   PRIORITY destinations. 100% = ignore player, 50% = half notice range
  LIKE DIABLO: add icons/colored auras to enemies for easy reuse. High hp, fast, etc.
