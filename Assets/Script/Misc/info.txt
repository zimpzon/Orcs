CAM: 8.4

SMART DESIGN
 getting to orcs quickly can be stressful. maybe reduce xp.
 xp is not balanced, drops become worthless
 orc sword is required atm, fix that it gets swarmed an is impossible to get.
 really need current and new value for choices
 save baby knight? can then use orc enemies
 friendly is blue'ish, deadly is red'ish.
 COHERENT DESIGN, it is now spells :)
  declarative spawning!
  batter enemy creation than prefab. scriptable objects? factory? json? custom?
  balance/rewards for picking up orc and killing enemies
  synergies for choices, aha-moments for players, feels good (chance to X on shot + attack speed)

BRAINSTORM
LOSE ALL GOLD BUT PERMANTLY +dam and +gold (buy shop item)
  background in title screen could have moving enemies.
  bullets dropped on ground when moving, arming time, then fly. could be cool to surround enemies
  can "ascending" like Cookie Clicker be done? Possibly with new chars? reset all progress and get double gold and xp? could be greyed out button with explanation.
  enemies that follows paths and just shoots?
  shield/sword enemies loses items which flies away, and continues as plain enemies.
  use forcedDestination to make groups? if not in a group scan for friends, attach them to you and assign an offset they will maintain.
  chance to deflect projectiles? make 'em blue.
  hit furthest enemy :)
  +1 bullet is too good, +0.x instead
  chain-something, lightning...
  health + health regen pickups that are temp (voluntary uregency)   urgency with "loot goblins"? / money
  rare pickup that gives a bonus choice
  drop stuff that attacks when and enemy is close
  pool of stuff on the floor
  conditions on upgrades, so you can upgrade weapon fully without shop, but after using shop you will get other choices.
  when you get an upgrade, immediately fire it, much more fun
  taking damage = 0.5 sec shield, very long cooldown
  random portal leading to bonus map?
  ICONS on choices would help A LOT! Machinegun, orc, explosion for dam or dead ogre? green ogre for poison
  spawn large stationary enemies? either shooting or just being in the way. Could use avoidance for actors.
  very dark map?
  horn of Orcdor: every 10 seconds the baby orc will walk towards you OR if not picked up for X seconds
  ai can be reused for multiple chars with no or simples param changes. still gives the impression of many enemies.
     - ai can have some options (exists: speed, hp, weight), projectiles, cd, etc. snipers, shotguns

SPAWNS
  despawn after forced target reached, Y/N
  more spawns when killed faster
  timer based sections, to control pace
  special events besides grunts (bosses, casters, etc.)
  orcs, every x orcs spawns a boss, bosses reward:
  background color change for incoming danger! bosses, waves etc.
   moving wall of big ogres, need to shoot hole (move backwards lolz?)
   shapes, desired moving target (ex formations)
   PRIORITY destinations. 100% = ignore player, 50% = half notice range
  LIKE DIABLO: add icons to enemies for easy reuse. High hp, fast, etc.

AUTOGEN
  from game perspective:
    get enemy(type), that is it? spawner will pick the right one for bosses etc.
  
  data driven:
    sprites path
    enum name
    components to add
    name base class (ActorBase or custom)

  create sprite lists
  create default data for each
  if baseClass is set, 
  create classes for each (need filename, can also be used for enum)
  

small ogre, shield1
  shield2 are the same with larger (cooler shield) could be later waves)
  unarmed are the same, just no shield and no weapon
